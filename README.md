# Product Backlog<a name = "backlog"></a>

the Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering. The Epics/Themes column are designed to split the entire program up into very high level sections. These sections are then split into user stories which is located on the next column. The user stories are all the actions that specific users can do on the particular platform. These actions are then prioritised on the next column and are estimated on the next column. Task estimation is discussed further down the article.

# Task Estimation<a name = "taskEst"></a>

The task estimation is used by using the "Fist of five" technique. This technique allows participants to quickly place a vote ranging from zero to five. The decision in question is presented and participants raise their hands, showing their vote by way of the number of fingers that they hold up. Often Fist of Five is used to indicate the difficulty of a particular user story.</br>

A fist would indicate zero, a vote completely against whatever issue was being raised. A one (one story point) would denote that the user story is very easy to develop and would not take much time at all. A five (five story points) would indicate extreme difficulty and a lot of road blocks in order to develop the particular user story. Raising three fingers (three story points) would indicate that although there is some difficulty, the team member would be comfortable enough in developing the user story. </br>

The story points are always located in the product backlog, as you can see above.

The total story points in the product backlog is noted down. There are 3 sprints in total. For each sprint, the team has a capacity of 8 story points. So we must reach as close as possible to capacity with user stories.</br></br>
Total points: 23</br>
Team capacity: 8

# Sprints<a name = "sprint1"></a>

Sprint is one timeboxed iteration of a continuous development cycle. Within a Sprint, planned amount of work has to be completed by the team and made ready for review. The term is mainly used in Scrum Agile methodology but somewhat basic idea of Kanban continuous delivery is also essence of Sprint Scrum.

Sprint literal meaning is a short race at full speed. Accordingly, teams usually define a short duration of a Sprint up to 2-4 weeks. Team collaboratively sets their target with Product Owner as “Sprint Goal” and plan their work in “Sprint backlog”. As soon race starts after planning session, team work together to complete planned work effectively and make it ready for review by the end of that period.

High level User Stories readiness in Product backlog is the prerequisite of starting a Sprint Cycle. Sprint Analytics help Scrum Master and Product Owner to know the progress of Sprint in a glance. It is the place to define Sprint Goal and Definition of Done for each Sprint.

When the sprint is started the team member is assigned a user story number and the row is placed in the "In progress" state. Once the assignment is finished, the row is placed in the "Done" state and the actual time taken is recorded for a burn down chart.
